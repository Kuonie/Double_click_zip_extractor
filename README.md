# Double_click_zip_extractor

# Information
Basically, what the name says, you can directly double-click on any zip file and it will extract the zip file at the same location. It's similar to how you unzip the zip file in mac OS. This is a simple code made with Python, just works! Good for small to medium files.


# How to use

Run the RARAutoExtractorSetup.exe file as Administrator, and it should install and set it as the default program for zip files./n
If it does not set itself as the default program, go to "Default Apps" in settings. /n
Search for .zip file type and select "extractor" as the default app./n
And it's done!/n


# Uninstall

Go to the installed folder, and click on uninstall!

# Additional Notes & Personal usage

I made it for my team at my office, where we get a lot of files in zip and we need to extract them. My team was using Mac, and it was easy; we just double-clicked, and it got extracted. But after my team moved to Windows, right-clicking and clicking on extract felt like a chore as there were too many zip files to extract, and it took a lot of time. So I came up with this simple Python program which brings Mac-like zip extraction to Windows.

My team and I use it on a daily basis, and it works for us. Our files are generally between a few MB to couple of GB, never tried this on files larger than 10 GB. So let me know your experience. 

# Important Notes: 
1. It doesn't have a progress bar, so sometimes it might appear like nothing's happening, but it might take a little bit of time to extract if it is a large file.
2. It doesn't support all types of zip files, especially if it has a password that protects them. So be careful!
